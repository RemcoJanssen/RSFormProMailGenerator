RSFormProMailGenerator

With RSFormProMailGenerator you can easily generate Admin Mails and User Mails for all you RSForm!Pro based forms.

When you create a form in RSForm!Pro and you want to email the form results to Admin or to the User who fills the form, you have to markup the email layout.
For (small and) large forms this can be tedious job. Every form field can be identified with two codes:

{fieldname:caption} for the field caption (for example: Name)
{fieldname:value} for the field value (the data that was entered by the website visitor)

When you markup a table-based email, every field has to be added to the table. With RSFormProMailGenerator you can quickly generate the HTML code for all the form fields.
RSFormProMailGenerator runs as a standalone application, outside of Joomla! All you need to do is upload it to your Joomla! website and go!

Installation instructions

1. Login with FTP to your Joomla website.
2. In the root of the site create a new folder for RSFormProMailGenerator.
   Make sure you choose a name that only you know, for example "mailformgen"
3. Upload all files of RSFormProMailGenerator to the newly created folder.
4. Close your FTP session.
5. Go to the frontend of your Joomla website, for exaple: www.yoursite.com
6. Add the name of the RSFormProMailGenerator behind the frontend URL,
   for exaple www.yoursite.com/mailformgen
   
That is all!

If you no longer need to generate Admin Mails or User Mails, I advise you to remove the RSFormProMailGenerator from your website.
RSFormProMailGenerator is not a security threat to your website, but an external person who runs RSFormProMailGenerator on your website can see what forms you have installed.
